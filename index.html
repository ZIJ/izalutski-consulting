            <p class="question">
                Why is that project taking so long?
            </p class="question">
            <p class="question">
                Why is there a perfect explanation for every delay, yet it happens again and again?
            </p>
            <p class="question">
                Why so much work seems to be happening but so little value is actually delivered?
            </p>
            <p class="question">
                Does it have to be so just because itâ€™s so common? Or is there a better way?
            </p>
            <p>
                Software can have enormous impact, but it is all too easy to do it wrong because it is so complex and abstract at the same time. No amount of resources or technical talent can fix it without finding the root cause which is often very uncomfortable truth: we do not know well enough what we are doing and whether we should continue or change direction. We overspecialize. Uncertainty in software is greater than in any other field yet we keep treating it as construction.
